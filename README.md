odin RPS project. 

This project will follow the outline provided by: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

The goal of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript and simple logic flows.

This project is a simple children's game, Rock Paper Scissors which pits a player against a computer challenger in a best of five challenge. 

Both player and computer will choose either rock, paper, or scissors. Each of the three choices will either result in a win or loss if opposites are chosen, or if the same 
choice is made it will result in a draw.
